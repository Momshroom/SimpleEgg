# SimpleEgg
A Bukkit/Spigot plugin to allow capture and conversion of mobs to spawn eggs.

Available on BukkitDev and Spigot Resources!

SimpleEgg is a free, open source Bukkit/Spigot plugin that makes it possible to capture animals and convert them into spawn eggs. The plugin works by listening for animals to get hit by projectile eggs. If a player throws an egg and hits an animal and has five diamonds in their inventory, the five diamonds are removed, and the animal is replaced with a spawn egg. This spawn egg is special, however. Normally, spawn eggs spawn whatever creature it is for with a random pool of characteristics. SimpleEgg however remembers the characteristics of the animals captured. A tamed wolf with a purple collar will appear identical after being captured and respawned. Same owner, same tame state, same collar color. The same goes for any animal with special data. Only two exceptions of capturable animals exist, bats and squids, and I hope to change this in the future.
